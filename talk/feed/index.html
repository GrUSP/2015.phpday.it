How does staying up until the wee hours of the morning working on a project, just to turn around and go work your day job “work”? Exactly how does community pay the bills each month? Let me show you how it works.</p>
<p>Let’s jog through my career as a programmer. Along the way, we will take a look at how community has not only affected my career in a positive manner; it has been a jet pack strapped to my career. I’m just a programmer, not even a great one. If community can help my career, it can help anyone’s.</p>
